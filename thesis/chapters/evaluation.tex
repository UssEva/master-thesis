\chapter{Evaluation}\label{ch:evaluation}
Before any of the research questions could be answered, we searched for security patterns that are IoT-specific and already exist in literature. With the help of this newly created pattern catalogue we are now able to answer the previously stated RQs by following these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[RQ1] Compare the number of security patterns of each layer in the IoT WFRM.
	\item[RQ2] List the important security goals for an IoT system and check for each pattern which goals it protects. Compare the coverage of the different security goals.
	\item[RQ3] List the OWASP top ten most common security vulnerabilities within IoT and check if each vulnerability is solved by at least one pattern.
\end{enumerate}
	
	
\section{Data Set of IoT Security Primary Studies}\label{sec:patterns}
The foundation for the security pattern catalogue in Chapter~\ref{ch:catalogue}, which was created specifically for this master's thesis, can be found in Table~\ref{tab:paper-set}. This table showcases in chronological order the collected data set of primary studies that are focused on IoT security patterns.

\section{RQ1: IoT World Forum Reference Model Categorization}\label{sec:rq1}
In order to answer RQ1 \emph{\q{Which layer in the IoT WFRM is covered by the least security patterns?}}, we went through each paper in our data set in Table~\ref{tab:paper-set} and assigned each pattern to its corresponding layer in the model. The pattern distribution for each WFRM layer is illustrated with a corresponding pie chart in Figure~\ref{fig:rq1}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{img/RQ1}
	\caption{The WFRM layer distribution of IoT security patterns}
	\label{fig:rq1}
\end{figure}

According to the calculated distribution of IoT security patterns that are attributed to the different layers of the WFRM, most patterns can be almost equally found in the Application (L5) and Connectivity (L2) layers. With 15 and 14 patterns respectively these two layers take almost half of the total of 61 IoT security patterns that were found during our search process. The Edge Computing (L3) and Data Accumulation (L4) layers on the other hand are with three patterns each on the lower end of the pattern coverage. When looking at the reasoning for this occurrence, we can say that Edge Computing can be seen as an own technology infrastructure that not all models consider a part of IoT. If we specifically searched for Edge functionality in publications, our success rate in finding such patterns would definitely be significantly higher. But because IoT was the main focus of our research topic, only a few publications that specified IoT as well as Edge technology at the same time could be found. The reason for Data Accumulation (L4) being under-represented with IoT security patterns in our study is definitely worth analysing further. Maybe because a secure storage is a big part of any computer system, mobile or stationary devices, there are only a few patterns that exist to date that specifically try to solve security problems in IoT devices. In conclusion, for a better distribution of patterns in the WFRM architecture the development of IoT security patterns for the Data Accumulation layer is encouraged.
 

\section{RQ2: Protected Security Goals}\label{sec:rq2}
With the second RQ we want to answer the question which security goals are covered by the patterns in the catalogue of Chapter~\ref{ch:catalogue} and how the coverage of the rest can be improved. Like for RQ1 we looked at each paper from the data set in Table~\ref{tab:paper-set} and assigned the specific security goals to each of them. The total number of times each security objective is covered by a pattern is shown in Table~\ref{tab:rq2}.

\begin{table}[ht]
	\centering
	\caption{Security objectives addressed by IoT security patterns}
	\label{tab:rq2}
	\begin{tabular}{l|c}
		\hline
		\textbf{Security Objective} & \textbf{Pattern Count} \\
		\hline
		Confidentiality     & 30    \\
		Integrity           & 20    \\
		Availability        & 18    \\
		Authentication      & 27    \\
		Authorization       & 24    \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

With a total of 30 publications the confidentiality objective is the goal that is covered the most in our data set. It is a security requirement that is surely easier to achieve than the others, because any system should protect their sensitive data. Thus, even if an IoT system is built without any security aspects in mind, the probability that confidentiality is ensured is pretty high. Therefore, it is usual that there exist many patterns that guarantee this objective. Availability, however, is the security goal with the least amount of coverage. The objective to ensure that a system is accessible for as long and often as possible can be quite challenging. One other reason for this could be, that when thinking about security, availability is not the most obvious choice compared to confidentiality or integrity. But by keeping the aspect of replication in mind to ensure availability when developing new IoT technologies, IoT architectures will be more secure in the future. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{img/RQ2}
	\caption{IoT security patterns with their security concerns per WFRM layer}
	\label{fig:rq2}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:rq2} compares the coverage of different security objectives in each layer of the WFRM architecture. The outlier in the bar plot is definitely the Data Accumulation (L4) layer. With only three security goals being covered and authentication and authorization being absent entirely, one sees clearly the lack of security solutions for storages of IoT devices. When analysed further one could say, that the reason for authentication being neglected lies in these mechanisms usually being implemented in higher layers of the IoT architecture. Interesting to mention is also the lack of availability support in the Collaboration \& Processes (L7) layer. But because this layer is focused on user interactions and not the applications of the system themselves, it makes sense that availability is not a priority here. 


\section{RQ3: Solutions for Common Vulnerabilities}\label{sec:rq3}
Looking at the OWASP top ten IoT vulnerabilities there are countless of new issues that arise every year while developing IoT systems. In RQ3 we now want to know if any of the security patterns in our pattern catalogue in Chapter~\ref{ch:catalogue} are able to solve some of these common mistakes developers tend to make in IoT environments. The following Figure~\ref{fig:rq3} shows which common vulnerabilities can be solved with the found IoT security patterns. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{img/RQ3}
	\caption{Potential pattern solutions for the OWASP common vulnerabilities}
	\label{fig:rq3}
\end{figure}

It seems that each common vulnerability from the OWASP top ten can be (partially) solved by at least one IoT security pattern from our catalogue. The easiest one to fix is apparently T7 which focuses on insecure data transfer and storage. At least 34 different IoT security patterns that we found have a solution that could remove parts of the vulnerability and improve the handling of data in IoT devices. On the other hand T4 is apparently the hardest one to solve with only one pattern addressing this issue. If we look into its description, the problem is the lack of ability to securely update the IoT device. This is a very specific issue that also is highly dependent on the hardware of the device and its user interface. For a better update management of IoT devices further research in terms of security patterns is highly recommended in this area.

When we now look into the WFRM layer distribution of the IoT security patterns for each individual OWASP vulnerability, the pie charts in Figure~\ref{fig:pies} mirror the results of the previous bar plot. While the pie charts for T2, T3 and T7 (see Figures~\ref{fig:t2}, \ref{fig:t3}, and \ref{fig:t7} respectively) show the most diverse range of pattern solutions from up to six different layers, the one for T4 in Figure~\ref{fig:t4} has only patterns from the Physical Devices \& Controllers (L1) layer. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{img/legend}

	\label{fig:pies}
\end{figure}

Therefore, we see a connection between the found IoT security patterns for a specific OWASP vulnerability and the number of layers the various solutions are from. This assumption is confirmed by the following Figure~\ref{fig:corr}, which consists of a scatter plot that showcases the correlation between the pattern quantity and their layer distribution with a value of 0.86808368. This correlation coefficient always ranges from -1 to 1 and indicates the strength of the relationship between two variables. A value between 0.7 and 1 shows a strong connection and the positive sign indicates, that more patterns as solutions for a specific vulnerability also mean a more diverse distribution of WFRM layers for these IoT patterns.

\section{Use Case Application}\label{sec:use_case}
Before we discuss the findings of our research work, let's see how the created pattern catalogue can be used in a real life situation. The pattern collection was designed to easily function as a checklist. To showcase the pattern selection process, we describe the following IoT home scenario. It is important to note, that in this example we assume that the system is only used by the owner of the house and no further security measures were taken than the ones that were already integrated into the system. 

This smart home contains different connected devices that are distributed in the living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom and entrance of the house. All electronic devices run on the custom firmware Tasmota\footnote{\href{https://tasmota.github.io/docs}{https://tasmota.github.io/docs, last accessed: 25.02.2023.}} and include: Four RGB LED  bulbs\footnote{\href{https://www.tasmota.shop/gb/lights/7-led-rgb-bulb-wifi-e27-15w.html}{https://www.tasmota.shop/gb/lights/7-led-rgb-bulb-wifi-e27-15w.html, last accessed: 25.02.2023.}}, six Shelly\footnote{\href{https://www.shelly.cloud/en-de/products/product-overview/1xs1}{https://www.shelly.cloud/en-de/products/product-overview/1xs1, last accessed: 25.02.2023.}} that function as light controllers, and five smart plugs\footnote{\href{https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07D73S72W}{https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07D73S72W, last accessed: 25.02.2023.}}. In addition, a Raspberry PI with HomeBridge\footnote{\href{https://homebridge.io}{https://homebridge.io, last accessed: 25.02.2023.}} allows the integration of HomeKit into the network that controls the following devices: Two televisions\footnote{\href{https://plugins.hoobs.org/plugin/homebridge-samsung-tizen}{https://plugins.hoobs.org/plugin/homebridge-samsung-tizen, last accessed: 25.02.2023.}}, four Sonos ZonePlayers\footnote{\href{https://plugins.hoobs.org/plugin/homebridge-zp}{https://plugins.hoobs.org/plugin/homebridge-zp, last accessed: 25.02.2023.}}, a Ring camera and doorbell\footnote{\href{https://plugins.hoobs.org/plugin/homebridge-ring}{https://plugins.hoobs.org/plugin/homebridge-ring, last accessed: 25.02.2023.}}.

After we established the use case example, we can inspect each pattern of the catalogue in Chapter~\ref{ch:catalogue} and check its applicability in the given context. The evaluation results can be found in Table~\ref{tab:use-case} with (-) indicating this pattern is not suitable for this system, (o) being used in cases where the given system has already implemented similar security features this pattern would provide, and (+) marking recommended patterns to implement to further optimize the system design.

\end{landscape}

While there are many patterns that are not suitable to be implemented in this kind of smart home scenario, like BlockBD~\ref{p:block} or the Web of Trust~\ref{p:trust}, just as many are already integrated into the system, e.g Uptime~\ref{p:uptime} or Account Lockout~\ref{p:lockout}. Nevertheless by going through the catalogue and analysing each pattern individually, we found 25 patterns that can be used to optimize the security measures in this smart home example. Spread across all layers of the WFRM architecture, one can choose from a variety of patterns that include Symmetric Key Cryptography~\ref{p:hardware}, Server Sandbox~\ref{p:sandbox} or even simpler solutions like a combination of a Blacklist~\ref{p:black} and a Whitelist~\ref{p:white}. 

This use case demonstrates that our pattern catalogue can act as an easy guideline to improve the security of a system. The evaluation process can be as straightforward as using the catalogue as a checklist while other approaches could include the sorting by WFRM layers or even by security objectives. Regardless of which method one uses, every system has vulnerabilities that can benefit from even the most obvious or trivial security features, like a Single Access Point~\ref{p:sap}.
